A very basic LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov√°sz) lattice reduction algorithm in Haskell.

* As of now, it works on 2 small test cases, but not on larger ones.
* There are *no* optimizations implemented yet
* The interface is currently not well-designed, it should of course take at least Integer instead of Rational
* Need to implement Babai's CVP algorithm
* etc
