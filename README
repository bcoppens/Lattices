A very basic LLL (Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov√°sz) lattice reduction algorithm in Haskell.

* As of now, it seems to work on 2 small test cases and on some larger ones. I need to generate tests for it, for example comparing it to NTL's LLL output
* There are *no* optimizations implemented yet
* The interface is currently not well-designed, it should of course take at least Integer instead of Rational
* etc
